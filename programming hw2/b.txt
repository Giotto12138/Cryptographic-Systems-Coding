 In order to allow for grading to be eﬃcient, there will be strict submission guidelines. Failure to follow will result in a grade penalty. Make sure that your program takes input exactly as the speciﬁcation indicates. Similarly, ensure that programs output exactly what is speciﬁed. We will be providing a testing harness that will mock the expected inputs and outputs so that everyone can validate their code before submitting. Additionally, please make sure that the code submission for each part of the assignment is a self-contained .go ﬁle. We know that organizing code into packages is good practice, but we have decided it is preferable to have a consistent build pattern for all submissions.
